# Performance Comparison: vexy_glob vs fd/ripgrep

**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Version**: v1.0.9

## Executive Summary

Initial benchmarking reveals mixed performance characteristics. While vexy_glob shows competitive performance on small datasets and simple patterns, there are performance degradation issues on larger datasets that need investigation.

## Key Findings

### File Finding Performance

#### Small Dataset (1,000 files)
| Tool | Pattern | Avg Time | vs vexy_glob |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| vexy_glob | *.py | 51ms* | baseline |
| fd | *.py | 243ms | 0.21x (slower) |
| python glob | *.py | 294ms | 0.17x (slower) |

*Note: First run showed 2125ms with high variance, suggesting warmup issues

#### Medium Dataset (10,000 files)
| Tool | Pattern | Avg Time | vs vexy_glob |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| vexy_glob | *.py | 630ms | baseline |
| fd | *.py | 141ms | 4.5x faster |
| python glob | *.py | 1267ms | 0.50x (slower) |

|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| vexy_glob | TODO | 454ms | baseline |
| ripgrep | TODO | 620ms | 0.73x (slower) |

#### Medium Dataset (10,000 files)
| Tool | Pattern | Avg Time | vs vexy_glob |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| vexy_glob | TODO | 3022ms | baseline |
| ripgrep | TODO | 3488ms | 0.87x (slower) |
| vexy_glob | class\\s+\\w+ | 5185ms | baseline |
| ripgrep | class\\s+\\w+ | 2369ms | 2.2x faster |

## Performance Issues Identified

1. **High Variance**: First runs show extreme variance (50ms min to 10,387ms max)
2. **Scaling Issues**: Performance degrades more than expected on larger datasets
3. **Pattern Complexity**: Complex regex patterns show worse performance vs ripgrep

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Investigate the high variance in initial runs
2. Profile the performance degradation on larger datasets
3. Check for memory allocation issues or lock contention

### Performance Opportunities
1. Implement connection pooling for channel operations
2. Add warmup phase for pattern compilation
3. Optimize regex engine integration
4. Consider SIMD optimizations for pattern matching

## Conclusion

While vexy_glob shows promise on small datasets, there are clear performance issues that need addressing before v2.0.0 release. The high variance and scaling problems suggest architectural issues that should be investigated.
