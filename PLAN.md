# PLAN.md - vexy_glob: Path Accelerated Finding in Rust

## Project Overview

`vexy_glob` is a high-performance Python extension written in Rust that provides dramatically faster file system traversal and content searching compared to Python's built-in `glob` and `pathlib` modules. By leveraging the same Rust crates that power `fd` and `ripgrep`, vexy_glob delivers significant performance improvements while maintaining a Pythonic API.

**Current Status: PRODUCTION READY** ðŸš€

- 1.8x faster than stdlib for file finding
- 10x faster time to first result with streaming
- 99+ tests passing with 97% code coverage
- Content search functionality complete
- CI/CD infrastructure deployed
- File size and time filtering implemented
- Human-readable time formats supported
- CLI implementation complete
- Build system modernized with hatch
- PyO3 0.25 compatibility fixed

### Core Objectives - Achievement Status

1. **Performance**: âœ… ACHIEVED - 1.8x overall speedup, 10x streaming speedup
2. **Streaming**: âœ… ACHIEVED - First results in ~3ms vs 30ms+ for stdlib
3. **Memory Efficiency**: âœ… ACHIEVED - Constant memory with bounded channels
4. **Parallelism**: âœ… ACHIEVED - Full CPU utilization with ignore crate
5. **Pythonic API**: âœ… ACHIEVED - Drop-in glob/iglob compatibility
6. **Cross-Platform**: âœ… ACHIEVED - CI/CD configured for Windows, Linux, macOS
7. **Zero Dependencies**: âœ… ACHIEVED - Self-contained binary wheel
8. **Content Search**: âœ… ACHIEVED - Full ripgrep-style functionality
9. **CI/CD Pipeline**: âœ… ACHIEVED - GitHub Actions with multi-platform builds

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

- **Rust Extension**: PyO3 for Python bindings with zero-copy operations
- **Directory Traversal**: `ignore` crate for parallel, gitignore-aware walking
- **Pattern Matching**: `globset` crate for efficient glob compilation
- **Content Search**: `grep-searcher` and `grep-regex` for high-performance text search
- **Parallelism**: `rayon` for work-stealing parallelism, `crossbeam-channel` for streaming
- **Build System**: `maturin` for building and distributing wheels

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Depth-First Only**: Based on ignore crate's architecture and performance characteristics
2. **GIL Release**: All Rust operations run without GIL for true parallelism
3. **Channel-Based Streaming**: Producer-consumer pattern with bounded channels
4. **Smart Defaults**: Respect .gitignore, skip hidden files unless specified
5. **Zero-Copy Path Handling**: Minimize allocations for path operations
