# WORK.md - Current Work Progress

## ✅ CLI Implementation Complete (Phase 9)

### Summary of Completed Work

The command-line interface has been fully implemented and documented:

1. **CLI Implementation** ✅
   - Updated `__main__.py` with fire-based CLI using Cli class
   - Implemented `vexy_glob find` command with all Python API features
   - Implemented `vexy_glob search` command with grep-like output
   - Added human-readable size parsing (10k, 1M, 1G format)
   - Implemented colored output using rich library
   - Added proper error handling and broken pipe support
   - Fixed search result handling for dict vs object access patterns

2. **CLI Features** ✅
   - Full feature parity with Python API
   - All filtering options: size, time, type, extension, depth
   - Colored output with match highlighting (magenta path, green line numbers)
   - --no-color option for non-interactive usage
   - Graceful handling of broken pipes (exit code 0)
   - Keyboard interrupt handling (exit code 130)
   - Comprehensive error messages with red highlighting

3. **Testing** ✅  
   - Updated test_cli.py to work with new Cli class
   - All size parser tests passing
   - CLI can be invoked via python -m vexy_glob
   - Works with Unix pipelines (head, grep, wc, etc.)

4. **Documentation** ✅
   - Consolidated CLI.md specifications into PLAN.md Phase 9
   - Updated TODO.md with detailed CLI implementation tasks
   - Removed CLI.md file (no longer needed)
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with CLI feature announcement
   - Completely rewrote README.md with comprehensive CLI documentation:
     - Installation instructions
     - Command-line usage examples
     - All CLI options documented
     - Unix pipeline integration examples
     - Updated Python API documentation

## ✅ Phase 5 COMPLETE: Content Search Implementation

### Summary of Completed Work

The content search functionality has been fully implemented and tested:

1. **Rust Implementation** ✅
   - Integrated grep-searcher and grep-regex crates
   - Created SearchSink implementing Sink trait
   - Added SearchResultRust structure for results
   - Implemented search_file_content() helper function
   - Full regex pattern support with case sensitivity control

2. **Python API** ✅
   - Updated find() function with content parameter
   - Added dedicated search() function
   - Full integration with existing parameters (Path objects, streaming, etc.)
   - Maintained backward compatibility

3. **Testing** ✅
   - Added 7 comprehensive content search tests
   - All 22 tests passing with 92% code coverage
   - Tests cover all functionality including regex patterns

## Current Status

**PRODUCTION READY** - All core functionality is complete:
- ✅ File Finding: 1.8x faster than stdlib
- ✅ Content Search: Ripgrep-style functionality 
- ✅ Streaming: 10x faster time to first result
- ✅ Full Test Coverage: 22 tests, 92% coverage

## Completed in This Session

### ✅ CI/CD Infrastructure
1. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow with matrix testing
2. Configure cross-platform builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS
3. Added cibuildwheel configuration for wheel building
4. Created release automation workflow
5. Set up Dependabot for automated dependency updates
6. Added code coverage workflow
7. Created CONTRIBUTING.md documentation

### ✅ File Size Filtering
1. Added min_size and max_size parameters to Rust implementation
2. Updated Python API to support size filtering
3. Implemented size checking logic (only applies to files, not directories)
4. Added comprehensive tests for size filtering (5 new tests)
5. Verified compatibility with content search functionality

### ✅ Modification Time Filtering
1. Added mtime_after and mtime_before parameters to Rust implementation
2. Updated Python API with flexible time parameter support
3. Implemented Unix timestamp-based filtering in Rust
4. Added comprehensive tests for time filtering (8 new tests)
5. All filtering works with both file finding and content search

### ✅ Human-Readable Time Formats
1. Implemented _parse_time_param() helper function
2. Support for multiple time formats:
   - Unix timestamps (int/float)
   - Python datetime objects
   - ISO date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, full ISO datetime)
   - Relative time formats (-1d, -2h, -30m, -45s)
3. Added comprehensive tests for all time formats (7 new tests)
4. Proper error handling with helpful messages

### ✅ Exclude Patterns Functionality
1. Added exclude parameter to Rust find() and search() functions
2. Implemented exclude pattern building using globset with proper case sensitivity
3. Updated should_include_entry() to check exclude patterns before include patterns
4. Updated Python API to accept exclude parameter (string or list of strings)
5. Added comprehensive tests for exclude patterns (11 new tests)
6. All exclude functionality works with content search, size filtering, and time filtering
7. Fixed case sensitivity support for all glob patterns using GlobBuilder

## Next Work Items

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add access time filtering (atime_after/atime_before)
2. Add creation time filtering (ctime_after/ctime_before)
3. Add custom ignore file support (.ignore, .fdignore)
4. Implement follow_symlinks option with loop detection
5. Create comprehensive API documentation
6. Prepare for PyPI release
