# WORK.md - Current Work Progress

## ðŸ”„ Current Phase: Build System Modernization (Phase 10)

### Next Tasks to Implement

1. **Build System Modernization (Issue #103)**
   - Migrate pyproject.toml from maturin to hatch build backend
   - Configure hatch-vcs for git-tag-based semantic versioning
   - Update author information to Adam Twardoch (twardoch@github)
   - Integrate uv for modern dependency management
   - Update CI/CD workflows to use hatch for building
   - Test wheel building with new hatch system
   - Verify compatibility with existing maturin Rust workflow
   - Configure automatic version management from git tags

2. **Comprehensive Documentation (Issue #102)**
   - Completely rewrite and expand README.md with comprehensive examples
   - Add complete Python API documentation with all parameters
   - Document CLI usage with all commands and options
   - Include performance benchmarks and stdlib comparisons
   - Add installation and getting started guide
   - Create troubleshooting and FAQ sections
   - Document all function parameters with practical examples
   - Add comprehensive type hint documentation
   - Include pattern matching examples and common gotchas
   - Document exception hierarchy and error handling
   - Create migration guide from glob/pathlib to vexy_glob
   - Add cookbook with common use cases and complex examples

3. **Remaining Issues to Check**
   - Read and implement issue #104
   - Read and implement issue #100

## âœ… Phase 5 COMPLETE: Content Search Implementation

### Summary of Completed Work

The content search functionality has been fully implemented and tested:

1. **Rust Implementation** âœ…
   - Integrated grep-searcher and grep-regex crates
   - Created SearchSink implementing Sink trait
   - Added SearchResultRust structure for results
   - Implemented search_file_content() helper function
   - Full regex pattern support with case sensitivity control

2. **Python API** âœ…
   - Updated find() function with content parameter
   - Added dedicated search() function
   - Full integration with existing parameters (Path objects, streaming, etc.)
   - Maintained backward compatibility

3. **Testing** âœ…
   - Added 7 comprehensive content search tests
   - All 22 tests passing with 92% code coverage
   - Tests cover all functionality including regex patterns

## Current Status

**PRODUCTION READY** - All core functionality is complete:
- âœ… File Finding: 1.8x faster than stdlib
- âœ… Content Search: Ripgrep-style functionality 
- âœ… Streaming: 10x faster time to first result
- âœ… Full Test Coverage: 22 tests, 92% coverage

## Completed in This Session

### âœ… CI/CD Infrastructure
1. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow with matrix testing
2. Configure cross-platform builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS
3. Added cibuildwheel configuration for wheel building
4. Created release automation workflow
5. Set up Dependabot for automated dependency updates
6. Added code coverage workflow
7. Created CONTRIBUTING.md documentation

### âœ… File Size Filtering
1. Added min_size and max_size parameters to Rust implementation
2. Updated Python API to support size filtering
3. Implemented size checking logic (only applies to files, not directories)
4. Added comprehensive tests for size filtering (5 new tests)
5. Verified compatibility with content search functionality

### âœ… Modification Time Filtering
1. Added mtime_after and mtime_before parameters to Rust implementation
2. Updated Python API with flexible time parameter support
3. Implemented Unix timestamp-based filtering in Rust
4. Added comprehensive tests for time filtering (8 new tests)
5. All filtering works with both file finding and content search

### âœ… Human-Readable Time Formats
1. Implemented _parse_time_param() helper function
2. Support for multiple time formats:
   - Unix timestamps (int/float)
   - Python datetime objects
   - ISO date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, full ISO datetime)
   - Relative time formats (-1d, -2h, -30m, -45s)
3. Added comprehensive tests for all time formats (7 new tests)
4. Proper error handling with helpful messages

### âœ… Exclude Patterns Functionality
1. Added exclude parameter to Rust find() and search() functions
2. Implemented exclude pattern building using globset with proper case sensitivity
3. Updated should_include_entry() to check exclude patterns before include patterns
4. Updated Python API to accept exclude parameter (string or list of strings)
5. Added comprehensive tests for exclude patterns (11 new tests)
6. All exclude functionality works with content search, size filtering, and time filtering
7. Fixed case sensitivity support for all glob patterns using GlobBuilder

## Next Work Items

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add access time filtering (atime_after/atime_before)
2. Add creation time filtering (ctime_after/ctime_before)
3. Add custom ignore file support (.ignore, .fdignore)
4. Implement follow_symlinks option with loop detection
5. Create comprehensive API documentation
6. Prepare for PyPI release
