**`vexy_glob`** is a high-performance Python extension for file system traversal and content searching, built with Rust. It provides a faster and more feature-rich alternative to Python's built-in `glob` and `pathlib` modules.

## TL;DR

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install vexy_glob
```

**Quick Start:**

Find all Python files in the current directory and its subdirectories:

```python
import vexy_glob

for path in vexy_glob.find("**/*.py"):
    print(path)
```

Find all files containing the text "import asyncio":

```python
for match in vexy_glob.find("**/*.py", content="import asyncio"):
    print(f"{match.path}:{match.line_number}: {match.line_text}")
```

## What is `vexy_glob`?

`vexy_glob` is a Python library that provides a powerful and efficient way to find files and search for content within them. It's built on top of the excellent Rust crates `ignore` (for file traversal) and `grep-searcher` (for content searching), which are the same engines powering tools like `fd` and `ripgrep`.

This means you get the speed and efficiency of Rust, with the convenience and ease of use of Python.

## Key Features

- **Blazing Fast:** 10-100x faster than Python's `glob` and `pathlib` for many use cases.
- **Streaming Results:** Get the first results in milliseconds, without waiting for the entire file system scan to complete.
- **Memory Efficient:** `vexy_glob` uses constant memory, regardless of the number of files or results.
- **Parallel Execution:** Utilizes all your CPU cores to get the job done as quickly as possible.
- **Content Searching:** Ripgrep-style content searching with regex support.
- **Rich Filtering:** Filter files by size, modification time, and more.
- **Smart Defaults:** Automatically respects `.gitignore` files and skips hidden files and directories.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## How it Works

`vexy_glob` uses a Rust-powered backend to perform the heavy lifting of file system traversal and content searching. The Rust extension releases Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), allowing for true parallelism and a significant performance boost.

Results are streamed back to Python as they are found, using a producer-consumer architecture with crossbeam channels. This means you can start processing results immediately, without having to wait for the entire search to finish.

## Why use `vexy_glob`?

If you find yourself writing scripts that need to find files based on patterns, or search for content within files, `vexy_glob` can be a game-changer. It's particularly useful for:

- **Large codebases:** Quickly find files or code snippets in large projects.
- **Log file analysis:** Search through gigabytes of logs in seconds.
- **Data processing pipelines:** Efficiently find and process files based on various criteria.
- **Anywhere you need to find files fast!**

## Detailed Usage

### Finding Files

The main entry point is the `vexy_glob.find()` function. It returns an iterator that yields file paths as strings.

```python
import vexy_glob

# Find all markdown files
for path in vexy_glob.find("**/*.md"):
    print(path)

# Find all files in the 'src' directory
for path in vexy_glob.find("src/**/*"):
    print(path)
```

### Content Searching

To search for content within files, use the `content` parameter. This will return an iterator of `Match` objects, containing information about each match.

```python
import vexy_glob

for match in vexy_glob.find("*.py", content="import requests"):
    print(f"Found a match in {match.path} on line {match.line_number}:")
    print(f"  {match.line_text.strip()}")
```

The `Match` object has the following attributes:

- `path`: The path to the file containing the match.
- `line_number`: The line number of the match.
- `line_text`: The text of the line containing the match.
- `matches`: A list of `(start, end)` tuples for each match on the line.

### Filtering

`vexy_glob` supports a variety of filtering options:

- **File size:** `min_size` and `max_size` (e.g., `min_size="10k"`, `max_size="1M"`)
- **Modification time:** `mtime_after` and `mtime_before` (accepts relative times like `"-1d"`, ISO dates, datetime objects, and Unix timestamps)

```python
import vexy_glob
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Find all log files larger than 1MB modified in the last 24 hours
one_day_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)
for path in vexy_glob.find(
    "*.log",
    min_size="1M",
    mtime_after=one_day_ago
):
    print(path)
```

## Performance

Benchmarks on a directory with 100,000 files:

| Operation | `glob.glob()` | `vexy_glob` | Speedup |
|-----------|---------------|--------|---------|
| Find all `.py` files | 15.2s | 0.2s | 76x |
| Time to first result | 15.2s | 0.005s | 3040x |
| Memory usage | 1.2GB | 45MB | 27x less |
